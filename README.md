# Survey of Data Science: Global Insights (2017‚Äì2021)

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes over 100,000 responses from the Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017‚Äì2021), revealing key trends in programming languages, gender representation, education, experience, and geographic distribution. Python dominates across all job roles, Asia leads in community participation, and a significant gender and income gap persists‚Äîespecially in Arab countries. Despite high educational attainment among women and youth, representation and salary equity remain challenges. Strategic investments in education, remote work, and inclusion are critical for equitable global growth in data science.

## 2. Gender Gap: Talent vs. Representation

### üë• Significant Imbalance in Participation and Pay

**Analysis**  
The data science community exhibits a pronounced gender gap:  
- **81.7%** of respondents are male.  
- **18.3%** are female.  

This imbalance extends to compensation, where males earn **57.9%** of the average salary versus **42.1%** for females.

**Evidence**  
- Males dominate top roles like **Business Analyst**, **ML Engineer**, and **Project Manager**.  
- Women show higher educational attainment: **45%** hold a Master‚Äôs degree vs. **42%** of men.  
- Despite this, women remain underrepresented in the workforce and underpaid.

**Recommendation**  
- Implement targeted recruitment to increase female participation.
